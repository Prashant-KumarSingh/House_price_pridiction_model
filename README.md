# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a model for predicting house prices.

## Files

* `housing.data`: The dataset used to train the model. This file contains the features and target variable for the house prices.
* `housing.names`: A file containing the names of the attributes in the `housing.data` file. This is helpful for interpreting the results of the model.
* `HousePricePrediction.ipynb`: The source code for the house price prediction model. This file contains all the code necessary to train the model.
* `Testing.ipynb`: The source code for testing the model. This file contains all the code necessary for testing the model.
* `Boston_House.joblib`: This file contains a trained machine learning model for predicting house prices in Boston.

## Model Description

* `Methdology`: I have used regression techniques like Linear regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest regressor.
